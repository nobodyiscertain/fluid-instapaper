Fluid Instapaper
================

I sure love me some Instapaper and Fluid, but I feel the Instapaper styles had grown a little stale.

This is nothing more than a style sheet to just change a few things around. Simple as that.

Here's what you have to look forward too:

If you too wish to freshen up an old favorite, then follow along.

Install
-------

You're obviously going to need Instapaper done up as a [Fluid app](http://fluidapp.com/). If that sounds like Geek speak, [head here](http://fluidapp.com/) and get it going.

Once it's installed, head to Window => Userstyles, and make your little popup window look like this:

Restart the Fluid app and Boom! Simple as that.
